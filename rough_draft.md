# IBPD - Ishwerdas Boring Policy Document


> **Current Status:** Lot of what, some of how, but a visible lack of "why" because writing why would take time. I will add why documents separately and link here soon.

> **Also need to add gifs/videos and other stuff to make this boring piece of crappy document interesting.**


## Hiring Policy
We don't compromise with quality and quality does not mean skills, it means person's behavior, our trust on that person, chemistry and synergy. We don't hire short term employees, but we also don't give a contract to sign. If we can't trust the guy or girl's word, we should not be hiring them at first place. We reach out to guys we can trust and that trust has to be built before Entry. We can keep someone on trial on very low priority tasks in order to judge that trustworthiness.

We enter as a trainee almost always, and when our first hour is charged to client (for now we are just a services company), we make an official entry. 

### How to get paid at Ishwerdas?
We can enter on one of these terms
* Trainee (occasional bonuses)
* Monthly Pay 
* Monthly Pay + Bonus for hours billed to client
* Hourly Pay - (Ishwerdas keeps a cut)


## We are Ishwerdas 
As soon as we enter ishwerdas, **we become Ishwerdas**. We add our upwork profile (if any) to our team account and we start putting proposals using Ishwerdas portfolio through ishwerdas. Wherever we represent ourselves publicly in a professional setting, we try to represent Ishwerdas alongwith. That's the only marketing team we have, our developers. We might choose to reveal that to someone (say a client) sooner or later, but someone hires any one of us - they are hiring ishwerdas and everyone at ishwerdas alongwith. *There's no one face of the company, we all are.*

## Also, we are more than Ishwerdas
We have the **right to private work life**. So we don't say no to private projects from private clients in private time. This right just like any other right comes with responsibilities attached to it. If 
a) it's felt that our private work life is harming Ishwerdas, or 
b) "lack of commitment to ishwerdas" seeps visibly out of that, 
then for the sake of everyone else working at ishwerdas we should separate our identity from Ishwerdas. Ishwerdas will even help us do that.

## Working hours and days
* We don't care as long as team communication can be facilitated. Work like whenever on whatever day.
* **Strongly encouraged to take regular weekly day offs**.
* We need to work at-least 30hrs/week over 4-5 days a week. (Ping inder personally on "why").

## Exit Policy
Ishwerdas should have and Idea long before you make an exit (unless it's because of urgent reasons). You should also have that understanding with clients you are working with. Make sure you discuss with client about the notice period that you will have to serve in case you exit.
